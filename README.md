# Aurora: version 1.0.0

This work presents the development of a two-dimensional structure analysis program using the Finite Element Method (FEM). For this, knowledge in Matrix Analysis of Structures and object-oriented programming in Java was used, which was chosen for being multiplatform and suitable for computational modeling of structures due to its level of abstraction of object-oriented modeling. Given that the resolution model results in a sparse matrix, graph theory and the breadth-first search algorithm were also used to optimize the resolution of the linear system associated with the structure, transforming the sparse stiffness matrix into a band matrix. To validate the program, examples were extracted from the literature, such as the bi-supported beam, the wall beam, the cantilever beam and the simply supported wedge and compared with the program results with the theory extracted from the literature and other reference software. All models analyzed showed convergence, thus validating the scope of this work.
